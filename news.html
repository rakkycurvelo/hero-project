								<p>  McCartney family launch Meat Free Monday's new film ‘One Day a Week’. With appearances by Paul, Mary and Stella McCartney, Woody Harrelson and Emma Stone, ‘One Day a Week’ highlights the damaging environmental impact of animal agriculture and encourages people to help by eating less meat. Ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23) next week, Meat Free Monday has released a short film about a huge contributor to climate change that is often left out of conference discussions – animal agriculture.</p>

								<p> <em>“There’s a simple but significant way to help protect the planet and all its inhabitants”</em>, says Paul to camera. <em>“And it starts with just one day a week.  One day without eating animal products can have a huge impact in helping maintain that delicate balance that sustains us all"</em>. </p><br>

								<p>With dire consequences for ourselves and future generations, livestock production results in vast amounts of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere. It requires increasingly unsustainable levels of precious resources including land, water and energy, and is a major contributor towards global environmental degradation and climate change.</p>
								 
								 
								<p>The Meat Free Monday campaign has had an incredible response since its launch in 2009, with many of the world’s leading authorities on climate change endorsing meat reduction as an effective way of fighting global warming.</p>
								 
								<p>The campaign’s new film ‘One Day a Week’, largely funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and produced in collaboration with French film director Yann Arthus-Bertrand’s Hope Production, amplifies this message using the breathtaking aerial photography with which Arthus-Bertrand has become synonymous.  </p>
								 
								<p>Narrated by Paul, and with appearances from Paul, Mary and Stella McCartney, Woody Harrelson and Emma Stone, the film describes how the beauty of the planet only exists through a delicate balance of climatic conditions – a balance we are dangerously disrupting through our insatiable desire for animal products.</p>

								<p>The film uses Paul's own music – tracks from his 1997 classical music album Standing Stone, as well as an unreleased song called 'Botswana'. </p>

								<p>Meat Free Monday’s aim is to raise awareness and inspire people to make a change in their diets from an easily achievable starting point. </p>

						<h3> Sir Paul McCartney warns that the “future of music is in danger”</h3>
							<div class="news">

						 		<strong> Font: </strong> <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/music/paul-mccartney-warns-future-of-music-is-in-danger-live-music-venues-uk-2216909"> NME </a>

								<p> Sir Paul McCartney has warned that “the future of music is in danger”, with the legendary Beatle lending his support to a new Parliamentary campaign which is aiming to save UK music venues from closure. McCartney has given his backing to the UK Music initiative, with senior Labour MP John Spellar introducing a new Planning Bill in the House of Commons today (January 10) in an effort to implement the “Agent of Change” principle into UK law. </p>

	   							 <label for="check_id"></label>	 -->
								 
								<p>  If implemented, the principle would force developers to take account of the impact of any new scheme on pre-existing businesses – like music venues – before going ahead with their plans. </p>


								<p> Speaking ahead of the launch of the campaign today, McCartney pledged his full support for Spellar’s bill. <em> “Without the grassroots clubs, pubs and music venues my career could have been very different,” he said. “If we don’t support music at this level, then the future of music in general is in danger”. </em> </p>

								<p>The UK Music campaign launched today with a gathering of supporters outside the Houses of Parliament in central London, with the likes of Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, Billy Bragg and Tom Watson MP among the prominent figures to show their support for the campaign.</p>

						<h3> Paul McCartney is Dead: Music's Most WTF Conspiracy Theories, Explained </h3>
							<div class="news">

						 		<strong> Font: </strong> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/paul-mccartney-musics-most-wtf-conspiracy-theories-explained-w511027"> Rolling Stone</a>

								<p> Paul McCartney became a household name when he rose to prominence as part of the Beatles in the 1960s, and his star power has held steady ever since the band broke up in 1970. But some conspiracy theorists believe that the Paul we know and love today is not Paul at all, but "Faul," or a faux Paul McCartney. </p>

								<p> According to a longstanding theory, the real Paul McCartney isn't the septuagenarian still tearing up stages – he actually died in the early hours of November 9th, 1966, after his car skidded off an icy road and crashed into a pole. </p>

		 					  <!--  <div class="more3">
	   							 <input type="checkbox3" id="check_id3">
	   							 <label for="check_id3"></label>	 !-->
							
								<p>Conspiracy theorists claim that John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr worried about how his death might impact the Beatles' huge commercial success, so they covered up his death by replacing him with a lookalike named Billy Shears, who looked, acted and even sounded the part.</p>
