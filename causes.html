						<h3> The OneVoice Movement</h3>
						 <strong> Font: </strong> <a href="https://www.paulmccartney.com/causes/the-onevoice-movement"> Paul McCartney Official Website </a>

							<img src="images/onevoice.jpg" alt="OneVoice Logo"> <p> OneVoice is a grassroots movement of Israeli and Palestinian citizens and international supporters who are fed up with the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and who are ready and eager to support a serious peace process, leading to a comprehensive agreement that will fulfil the hopes and beliefs of both the Palestinian and Israeli people to end occupation and all forms of violence and establish a two state solution. What makes OneVoice unique is that it appeals to the national self interest of both peoples. They don't ask each-side to like or love each other; rather they ask them to recognise the entangled nature of their fates, and the need to address the concerns on each side so that they can fulfill their respective moderate national ambitions. </p>
